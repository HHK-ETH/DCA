# DCA

DCA factory and vault built on top of bentobox and trident

## Benefits

* Decentralized - Everything is onchain.
* Highly customizable - Anyone can execute orders, any buy frequency can be selected, any oracle, most tokens.
* Interest bearing - Assets are sitting in the BentoBox and generate yield.
* Sushi - Generates fees for xSushi holders by enforcing Trident usage.
* Easy to use - Just transfer shares to the vault, orders are executed as long as there is enough token sitting inside.
* Long term - Bots are incentived to monitor and execute transactions as they receive up to 1% of the order.
